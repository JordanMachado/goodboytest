Goodboydigital test
===================

Here is the test to apply for Goodboy.

I used the "starter kit" [Budo-gulp-starter](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo-gulp-starter)

For the test I was inspired by the original game flappy bird. I added effects like filter elements reacting to audio.

I chose the bass drum n because the clicks of the mouse when I was testing flappy bird made me think of a drum rhythm the added effects agrees with the drum'n'bass world

I hope that pleases you :)
